  # It's very important that this expression goes first

  #
  # The order of the branches has to match the tags order.
  # Each branch has to have releases that are higher than the previous branch.
  # Maintenance branches are expected to have a specific range without a prefix.
  #   (see https://github.com/automata-tech/platform-go/pull/1881 for more details)
  # eg:
  # - v1.1.x      latest tag: v1.1.4 (smaller than the next)
  # - v1.2.x      latest tag: v1.2.2
  # - v1.3.x      latest tag: v1.3.9
  # - v2.0.x      latest tag: v2.0.1
  # - main        latest tag: >= v2.1
  # - rc          latest tag: >= main's latest tag
  - name: 'v+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x' # v1.x, v1.1.x, v2.x --- fix --- v1.0.x (v1.0.1)
    range: "${name.replace(/^v/g, '')}" # as above but without the 'v'. Must have this range to be considered a maintenance branch
  - name: main
  # The selected branch for the release candidates, if any
  - name: rc
